### What you learned about the codebase
That it's a Single Page Application (SPA). Its modular and uses component based design that uses state management system that is specific to managing each component indivudually.

### How AI assistance changed your workflow

It made it insanley fast, but more than that I could ask questions along the way, help it explain any concepts I didn't understand and in many ways taught me about coding as well as assisting me with coding.

### Challenges you encountered

How to be explicit with what I wanted the AI to do and what I didn't want it to do. Added in safe gaurds to my queries, like "Before you implement any changes to the README.md please ask for my approval." Also learned to scrap what it did, and start over with a new task.

### Strategies that worked well

Having it ask for approval before proceeding, and make sure I approved any changes before updating the code/files.
Working slowly, even though it made everything fast I would pause and ask questions, make it explain a phrase or coding lingo I wasn't familiar with, explain how we were resolving an issue etc.
Taking small manageable steps rather than writing a paragraph of everything I needed it to do. This allowed for me to still control what was being done to my code and files before anything was changed and I lost track of what the AI was doing. 

### Areas where AI was most/least helpful

Most helpful, explaining and doing. 
Least helpful, still to  be seen, but early on in the course just letting it run wild was not our best decision as we couldn't keep track of what the AI was doing and how it was implemtning changes, very hard to follow if your not taking it step by step.

### How did using an agentic AI tool compare to working alone?

Crazy fast! I think it would have taken hours/days to do some of the coding it helped with. But I really loved how it could teach and expand my coding knowledge. That was even more helpful than the actual coding. It felt like I had a senior developer sitting by my side helping to clarify and explain concepts to me.

### What was surprising about how the AI understood the code?

Ummm...that it could decipher so much from seemingly so little!

### Where did you need to correct or refine AI suggestions? 

With the Issue tickets, just taking time to slow down, break it down step by step.

### How did you verify AI-generated code was correct?

I tested while running the app, but also used AI generated tests to check the code.
